    Given a pydicom dataset of a single image file return three-dimensional numpy array.
    Also calculate a 4x4 affine transformation matrix that converts the ijk-pixel-indices
    into the xyz-coordinates in the DICOM patient's coordinate system.

    Returns a two-tuple containing the 3D-ndarray and the affine matrix.

    If `rescale` is set to `None` (the default), then the image array dtype
    will be preserved, unless any of the DICOM images contain either the
    `Rescale Slope
    <https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/ct-image/ct-image/00281053>`_ or the
    `Rescale Intercept <https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/ct-image/ct-image/00281052>`_
    attributes.  If either of these attributes are present they will be applied.

    If `rescale` is `True` the voxels will be cast to `float32`, if set to
    `False`, the original dtype will be preserved even if DICOM rescaling information is present.

    The returned array has the column-major byte-order.

    This function requires that the datasets:

    - Be in same series (have the same
      `Series Instance UID <https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/ct-image/general-series/0020000e>`_,
      `Modality <https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/ct-image/general-series/00080060>`_,
      and `SOP Class UID <https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/ct-image/sop-common/00080016>`_).
    - The binary storage of each slice must be the same (have the same
      `Bits Allocated <https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/ct-image/image-pixel/00280100>`_,
      `Bits Stored <https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/ct-image/image-pixel/00280101>`_,
      `High Bit <https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/ct-image/image-pixel/00280102>`_, and
      `Pixel Representation <https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/ct-image/image-pixel/00280103>`_).
    - The image slice must approximately form a grid. This means there can not
      be any missing internal slices (missing slices on the ends of the dataset
      are not detected).
    - It also means that  each slice must have the same
      `Rows <https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/ct-image/image-pixel/00280010>`_,
      `Columns <https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/ct-image/image-pixel/00280011>`_,
      `Pixel Spacing <https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/ct-image/image-plane/00280030>`_, and
      `Image Orientation (Patient) <https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/ct-image/image-plane/00200037>`_
      attribute values.
    - The direction cosines derived from the
      `Image Orientation (Patient) <https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/ct-image/image-plane/00200037>`_
      attribute must, within 1e-4, have a magnitude of 1.  The cosines must
      also be approximately perpendicular (their dot-product must be within
      1e-4 of 0).  Warnings are displayed if any of these approximations are
      below 1e-8, however, since we have seen real datasets with values up to
      1e-4, we let them pass.
    - The `Image Position (Patient) <https://dicom.innolitics.com/ciods/ct-image/image-plane/00200032>`_
      values must approximately form a line.

    If any of these conditions are not met, a `dicom_numpy.DicomImportException` is raised.
